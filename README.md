# Exploratory-Analysis-of-poll-of-Barcelona-fans
Analysis, machine learning, and prediction of a poll of Barcelona Football Club fans in r/Barca

I tested an hypothesis on whether the fans who were polled liked the current coach's decisions. 

I also did some fun testing of the central limit theorem and confidence intervals, both important statistics concepts. 

Machine learning and prediction coming soon.
